# Epsonia Bootstrap

*Bootstrap is still WIP*

Epsonia bootstrap is a toolw which takes in your `checks.json` file,
and generates a bash script which will bootstrap (setup) your
environment to contain the vulnerabilities which you want users to fix.

This removes the tediousness of creating a practice image, letting
you worry only about the configuration of Epsonia, and not the 
config of the VM image.
